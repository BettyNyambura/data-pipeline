# Table 2 Measurement System Precision

bias was −0.02 mm (Table 1). This corresponded to a 0.07% error in distance, which was not significantly different from zero (p > 0.05).

In-vivo inter-marker spacing and relative orientation of implanted markers varied considerably from dog to dog. On the first test day (ACL-I), inter-marker distances averaged 18.33 ± 5.5 mm (mean ± standard deviation), with a range of 5.5 to 31.6 mm. Mean inter-marker distance was nearly identical for the second test session (ACL-D), at 18.32 mm. Included angles from the marker triads ranged from 16° to 122°.

For the ACL-I tests, the inter-marker distance standard deviations averaged 0.064 mm (range 0.053 to 0.085 mm; Table 2.

# Table 3 Anatomical Marker Placement Repeatability

| Anatomical Marker Placement Standard Deviation (mm) |
|---|
| Medial Femoral Condyle | Lateral Femoral Condyle | Femoral Head |
| dog 1 | 0.32 | 0.20 | 0.25 |
| dog 2 | 0.33 | 0.33 | 0.40 |
| dog 3 | 0.17 | 0.26 | 0.22 |
| dog 4 | 0.33 | 0.34 | 0.07 |
| dog 5 | 0.46 | 0.27 | 0.79 |
| **Average** | **0.33 mm** | **0.28 mm** | **0.31 mm** |

The standard deviations in anatomical marker placement (Table 3) averaged 0.33 mm for the medial femoral condyle, 0.28 mm for the lateral femoral condyle and 0.35 mm for the center of the head of the femur.

Cross-trial standard deviations for tibio-femoral translations (calculated from estimated ACL origin to insertion, as described above) were similar for all three motion directions, averaging 0.14 mm (range 0.08 to 0.20 mm; Table 4 and Fig. 5). Variability in tibio-femoral rotations was more dependent on rotation axis, with cross-trial standard deviations averaging 1.71° for flexion/extension, 0.90° for internal/external rotation, and 0.40° for varus/valgus rotation. For all dogs, the axis with the largest variability was also the one with the greatest range of motion during the recorded movement (flexion/extension, approximately 50° range of motion), and the axis with the smallest variability also had the smallest range of motion (varus/valgus rotation; approximately 7°; Fig. 6).

The greatest change after ACL loss was increased anterior tibial translation (Fig. 5a), as would be expected. However, ACL loss led to visible differences in all six degrees of freedom. 3D reconstructions of joint positions (100 ms after paw-strike from both ACL-intact and ACL-deficient data for the same dog) clearly show the anterior tibial shift (Fig. 7).

Estimated ligament length was nearly constant for the ACL intact trials (Fig. 8, dashed lines; mean 16.9 ± 0.26 mm, range 16.2 to 17.4 mm). Estimated ACL origin to insertion distance increased in the ACL-D condition and showed a consistent pattern over trials. Similar results were observed in the remaining dogs.

# Discussion

A method for accurate assessment of dynamic, in-vivo 3D bone and joint motion has been presented. The method is based on established principles and methods, including radiostereometric analysis (RSA), rigid-body kinematics and CT-based anatomical modeling. These techniques have been adapted for use with a

**Figure 5 Knee translation vs. time for a typical dog (Dog 1). Translations are of the tibia relative to the femur (from ACL origin to insertion), expressed in the tibial anatomical coordinate system. Three ACL-intact trials (dashed lines) and three ACL-deficient trials are superimposed. The vertical dashed line indicates pawstrike (the beginning of the stance phase). Note the dramatic increase in anterior tibial translation after ACL loss.**
