### COLUMN 1

**283,800 mentally ill in prison or jail; 547,800 on probation**

Using the same criteria described for State prison inmates, 16% of offenders in local jails or on probation and 7% of inmates in Federal prisons were identified as mentally ill in recently completed BJS surveys (table 2). Probationers were somewhat less likely than inmates in State prisons or local jails to report an overnight stay in a mental hospital or treatment program but more likely to report a mental or emotional problem. Federal inmates had lower rates on both measures.

Assuming these rates have not changed since the surveys were conducted, an estimated 283,800 inmates in prison or jail were mentally ill as of June 30, 1998 (table 3). State prisons held an estimated 179,200 mentally ill offenders; Federal prisons held 7,900; and local jails, 96,700. Of those on probation at yearend 1998, an estimated 547,800 were mentally ill.

**White inmates more likely than blacks or Hispanics to report a mental illness**

Nearly a quarter of white State prison and local jail inmates and a fifth of white offenders on probation were identified as mentally ill (table 4). The rate of mental illness among black and Hispanic inmates and probationers was much lower. Among black offenders,

### COLUMN 2

**14% of those in State prison and local jails, and 10% of those on probation were identified as mentally ill. About 11% of Hispanic State prison and local jail inmates, and 9% of Hispanic offenders on probation had a mental illness.**

Black and Hispanic inmates in Federal prison were half as likely as white inmates to report a mental illness. About 6% of black inmates and 4% of Hispanic inmates reported a mental condition or an overnight stay in a mental hospital, compared to 12% of white Federal prison inmates.

The prevalence of mental illness also varied by gender, with females reporting a higher rate of mental illness than males. Nearly 24% of female State prison and local jail inmates, and 22% of female probationers were identified as mentally ill, compared to 16% of male State prison and jail inmates and 15% of male probationers.

**Offender mental illness highest among the middle-aged**

Offenders between ages 45 and 54 were the most likely to be identified as mentally ill. About 20% of State prisoners, 10% of Federal prisoners, 23% of jail inmates, and 21% of probationers between ages 45 and 54 had a mental illness, compared to 14% of State inmates, 7% of Federal inmates, 13% of jail inmates, and 14% of probationers age 24 or younger.

The highest rates of mental illness were among white females in State prison. An estimated 29% of white females, 20% of black females, and 22% of Hispanic females in State prison were identified as mentally ill. Nearly 4 in 10 white female inmates age 24 or younger were mentally ill.
