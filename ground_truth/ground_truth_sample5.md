## Summary
Deaths from ischemic heart-disease in 18 developed countries are not strongly associated with health-service factors such as doctor and nurse density. There is a negative association with gross national product per capita and a positive but inconsistent association with saturated and monounsaturated fat intake. The principal finding is a strong and specific negative association between ischemic heart-disease deaths and alcohol consumption. This is shown to be wholly attributable to wine consumption.

## INTRODUCTION
In a previous study [1,2] we reported on the associations between age-specific total mortality and a variety of economic, health-service, and dietary variables in 18 developed countries. Our conclusion was that, in general, the health-service factors showed negligible association with mortality, the dietary factors were of little importance, and the only consistent pattern was a negative association between gross national product (G.N.P.) per capita and mortality. Age-specific total mortality is, however, a crude measure by which to compare countries and so we have embarked upon a comparison of particular diseases. Here we shall present results for heart-disease.

## METHODS
The 18 countries used in this study are listed in table 1. The criteria for their selection are stated in our previous work [1]. Our mortality data consists of death-rates for males and females separately in the 55–64 age-group from hypertensive disease, ischemic heart-disease (I.H.D.), cerebro-vascular disease, and bronchitis plus emphysema and asthma, and in the 25–34 age-group death-rates from road accidents. These death-rates were obtained from the World Health Statistics Annual for 1970 (codes A82, A83, A85, A93, and AE138, respectively). The latter two causes of death were included in the study for comparison with heart-disease. It has been suggested [1] that France underreports I.H.D. deaths and we made allowance for this by analysing our data with France included and excluded.

Our health-service, economic, and demographic variables have been described elsewhere [1] as have cigarette consumption per capita per annum and total alcohol consumption.

The only additional variables we used in this study were:
(1) Consumption (litres per capita per annum) of absolute alcohol attributed separately to beer, wine, and spirits.
(2) Average daily intake of total calories and carbohydrate, and of total, saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat. Fat intake was also expressed as an energy percentage of total calorie intake. These figures were averaged over the period 1954–62 which is reasonable in relation to mortality in 1970.

(3) We also obtained daily cholesterol consumption [3] which, together with total saturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, we inserted into Keys' predictive equation for serum-cholesterol.

As in our previous study we adopted a pragmatic approach to the statistical analysis. We examined scatter diagrams of one variable plotted against another and product moment correlation coefficients. The variables showing the most convincing associations with the death-rates or with other "explanatory"
