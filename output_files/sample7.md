law banning radio and television advertising of
smell and chewing tobacco, a billion-dollar industry in the United States Winston Salem NC
The new law, a compromise between the industry and its critics, also would force all packages of
smokeless tobacco to carry rotating warning labels Winston Salem Source
Cigarette makers, although not required to rotate
warnings until last October, have lived with
warnings and had been hit with lawsuits.
But the health issues and marketing hype that
put cigarettes in a bind proved to be a windfall for
the smokeless industry through the 1970s and early
1980s. Pitched as a healthier, rugged alternative to
inhaling cigarettes, sales of snuff and chew soared.
The government and health community's benign
view of snuff and chew finally turned belligerent
last year. Studies show a sharp increase in the
number of teenagers and children, mainly boys,
using smokeless tobacco, and there is growing
evidence that sustained use can cause oral cancer
and gum disease.
This week, a national panel of health experts
met at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md., to sharpen public focus on the dangers of
smokeless tobacco.
"The panel believes that the public should be
warned that the use of smokeless tobacco, particularly
snuff when started in childhood, increases the
risk of oral cancer," the panel said in a report
released yesterday.
The report noted that scientific studies of
smokeless tobacco and health are inadequate. But,
using available evidence, it concluded:
Smokeless tobacco is addictive. Regular use
creates nicotine levels in the blood that are about
equal to those caused by smoking.
Lead present in smokeless tobacco can pose
risks to fetal development in pregnant women.
Regular use can cause gums to recede in the
areas of the mouth where smokeless tobacco is
kept.
Use of smokeless tobacco by children and
adolescents is increasing, with wide regional
differences. The Southeast is considered a high-risk
region.
The risk of oral cancer is four times higher
among snuff users than non-users, according to a
National Cancer Institute study of a group of North
Carolina women.
The smokeless tobacco industry maintains
there is no causal tie between snuff or chewing
tobacco and cancer.
But in light of the mounting evidence, Congress
acted on the issue last year. Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., held hearings on the issue last summer.
Waxman's health subcommittee proposed the
package warnings and broadcast ad ban.
The smokeless tobacco industry has agreed to
the warning labels and ad ban legislation before
Congress.
Warning labels make it harder for individuals to
argue in court that they didn't know the product
could harm their health.

Seattle Doctor Defaces Cigarette Ad
Associated Press
SEATTLE - A physician who says
he defaced a cigarette billboard be
cause he wants to "save lives" has
pleaded "not guilty" to a charge of de
struction of property.
Dr. Michael Lippman, 35, sprayed
the words "of cancer" after the
billboard message reading, "Camel
... it's a whole new world." He was
caught by police.
A pretrial hearing date was set for
Feb. 26. Lippman could face a fine of
up to $5,000 and a year in jail.
Lippman, a family physician in
Seattle, is a member of a group called
Washington DOCC, or Doctors Ought to
Care, which opposes smoking.
More smuggling
of cigarettes
called unlikely
The Associated Press
North Carolina officials say
they don't expect a new outbreak
of cigarette smuggling, despite
federal concerns about increasing
cigarette taxes in other states.
The Advisory Commission on
Intergovernmental Relations said
last month in Washington that
many states have raised cigarette
taxes since 1981, making it more
expensive for smugglers to bring in
cigarettes from states with lower
taxes and sell them at a profit.
North Carolina charges a 2-cent
tax on a pack of cigarettes,
compared with 21 cents in Michigan
and Pennsylvania. State and local
taxes add 23 cents to each
pack sold in New York City.
In addition, many states added 8
cents to the tax Oct. 1, when they
thought the federal tax would
decline by that amount in a
"sunset" provision, said Mike
Dodd, operations officer with the
Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms in Washington.
Congress decided to extend the
tax until March.
"Right now there's potential for
a very dynamic undercover econ
omy in cigarettes because the
federal government has not yet
stabilized its tax on cigarettes,"
he said. "The whole thing is in a
flux." The News and Observer
State officials say cigarette
smuggling may rise as per-pack
taxes go up elsewhere, but they
say it won't be anything like the
"bootlegging heyday" of the past
decade. Raleigh, N.C.
"There's still going there's a poten
tial for it, and certainly there is a
potential," said Gary Griffith,
supervisor of special operations
for the State Bureau of Investiga
tion. "But as far as a return to the
early 1970s, I don't think we'll
ever see a return to that."

a crime that is much more serious
than the crime with which he's been
charged, Ms. Smucker said [?].
Last month, Lippman, 35, sprayed
the words "of cancer" after the
billboard message reading, "Camel
... it's a whole new world." He was
caught by police.
A pretrial hearing date was set for
Feb. 26. Lippman could face a fine of
up to $5,000 and a year in jail.
Lippman, a family physician in
Seattle, is a member of a group called
Washington DOCC, or Doctors Ought to

In its coverage of the efforts to reform
the tobacco program, The News and
Observer has unfortunately taken the
position that there can be little if any
common ground between the producers
of tobacco and the manufacturers of
tobacco products. [?][?][?]
As a tobacco farmer, I find this
attitude very upsetting. In your Jan. 5
editorial, you wrote that "if the legisla
tion is enacted, cigarette manufacturers
will gain a role in setting future levels
of allowable tobacco production" and
treated this development as if it were a
calamity for farmers. [?][?][?]
In fact, this strikes me as one of the
best things about the bill -- it will link
the manufacturers' needs and the growers'
production in a manner that should
prevent further surpluses. To guard
against misuse by any of the parties
involved, the bill provides that the U.S.
secretary of agriculture may increase or
decrease the quota indicated by the
projections if he thinks an adjustment is
needed. The News and Observer
I don't claim that tobacco growers do
not have basically opposing interests
from the manufacturers; they want the
price low, we want it high. But in the
predicament all of us are currently in,
we all have a common interest in selling
the surplus tobacco now in storage and
seeing that another surplus does not
build up. The N&O does us all an
injustice by claiming that we cannot
share in this common goal.
